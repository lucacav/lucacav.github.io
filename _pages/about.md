I hold a Ph.D. in Electronic and Computer Engineering from the University of Genoa, Italy and I am a **Senior Research Scientist** at the Genoa branch of the Institute for Applied Mathematics and Information Technologies "*Enrico Magenes*" of the National Research Council of Italy [(CNR)](https://www.cnr.it). I am a board member for the Ph.D. program in Security, Risk and Vulnerability of the University of Genoa (Cybersecurity and Reliable AI). Currently, I am the head of the IMATI Research Unit of the National Inter-University Consortium for Telecommunications [(CNIT)](https://www.cnit.it) and I serve as an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security [(TIFS)](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/ieee-transactions-information-forensics-and-security). 

## Research Interests

My research primarily focuses on information hiding, network security, and the use of AI for threat detection. I am also interested in aspects related to the optimization of Internet-scale computing infrastructures and the management of complex software supply chains. My most recent research topics are:

**Information Hiding**: mitigation of threats trying to hide malicious payloads in digital images (especially via AI-based mechanisms to disrupt cloaked data), definition of IoCs outlining the presence of additional code for unpacking operations, and detection of covert channels.  

**Code Evolution**: use of software-related metrics to spot manipulations and injections during the development pipeline of software for the quantification of the "surface" for cloaking data. 

**LLMs**: integration of LLMs within analysis pipelines for the definition of test cases or the (automatic) deobfuscation of source code.

**Privacy and Freedom**: implications in terms of privacy and freedom of security mechanisms, integration of AI frameworks in large-scale services, and deployment of massive IoT for supporting digital twins. 

## Collaborations

I am always open to new collaborations or joint projects. I am also seeking for students wanting to do their B.Sc. or M.Sc. theses on my research topics. In case, send me an email.
