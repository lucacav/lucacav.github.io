I usually give talks in several universities, international conferences, summer schools, and industrial events. I also often act as a moderator or I give interviews on security and privacy aspects. Here you can find a (**very small**) selection of events where I was invited that offer some public material. 

## Summer Schools and Seminars ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

**Watermarking: Defense and Hazards**. Course delivered at the [Summer School on Artificial Intelligence for a Secure Society](https://ai4securesociety.sobigdata.it) on 
5-10 September, 2024 in Capo Vaticano, Italy. The goal of the course is to introduce core concepts of digital watermarking also by considering emerging AI-based applications. The repository with slides, exercises, and companion material is available [here](https://github.com/lucacav/AI4SS). 


**Malware and Information Hiding: Attack Models and Some Pitfalls**. Seminar delivered within the Ph.D.
Program in Electronics, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, [University of Pavia](https://portale.unipv.it/it), Pavia, Italy on May 2025. [[SLIDES]](../files/Information%20Hiding%20UniPavia%20-%20May%202025.pdf).


## Keynotes ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

**Shut Up â€™n Hide Yer Data**. Keynote on the use of steganography for attack and defense delivered at the PhD *Summer School on Extreme-scale Big Data Analytics and Scientific Computing on Heterogenous Platforms*, organized by the H2020 Project EVEREST - Design Environment for Extreme-Scale Big Data Analytics on Heterogeneous Platforms. [[SLIDES]](../files/Lake%20Como%20School%20-%20Keynote.pdf).

**Stegomalware: What Is it and What We Can Do?** Keynote on core research questions on steganographic malware delivered at the opening of the *5th International Workshop on Criminal Use of Information Hiding (CUING 2021)* within the 
*16th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security*, 17-20 August 2021. [[SLIDES]](../files/ARES%20-%20Keynote.pdf).

## Online Courses and Commentaries ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

Regulary, nice people of the Italian Research and Education Network ([GARR](https://www.garr.it/en/)) invite me at their (great) workshops for lecturing on my research topics. 

- **Covert Channel: Modelli di Attacco e Possibili Difese**. Webinar on basic aspects of network and local covert channels and possible countermeasures. [[VIDEO]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNUrxAH8Qc&t=4565s). 

- **Introduzione alle Minacce Steganografiche**. Webinar for introducing malware endowed with information hiding capabiilties and the main open research challenges. [[VIDEO]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ezfrw7g6vyc&t=2979s).

**Dialoghi sull'Ingegneria**. A short commentary performed at the end of the event **Dialoghi sull'Ingegeneria** organized by the Genoa Chapter of the [Italian Association of Professional Engineers](https://www.ordineingegneri.genova.it) on the importance of good engineering practices to enforce security of modern software supply chains.
