This is a collection of selected papers that I wrote during the years on security aspects, mainly network security and information hiding. Such works can be helpful to study a new topic or to have an introduction on my research interests. Many papers are open access or have a pre-print version in major repositories (e.g., arXiv or ResearchGate). If needed, drop me an email and I will be glad to provide the manuscript. A full list of my papers is available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.it/citations?hl=it&user=kfWVLTQAAAAJ). 

## Network Covert Channels

The papers deal with covert channels targeting netwotk traffic and Internet protocols and can serve as an introduction to the topic. They provide an investigation on the **real** quantification of security risks arising by the use of information hiding techniques in real scenarios. They also address the challenge of preventing covert channels from the early design stages, as their mitigation *a-posteriori* is inherently poorly-generalizable and hard.

## Steganogprahic Malware (Stegomalware)

The following works form the **trilogy** that I contributed to prepare on steganographic malware (oftend defined as *stegomalware*). The research here provides a clear definition of the menace, a widely-used classification of the various threats observed "in the wild", and a discussion of the major research steps that are needed to mitigate the impact of malicious software endowed with steganographic capabilities.

## Introductions to Various Security Topics

This series of works are surveys or introductory material that can be used as a starting point for investigating various security problems. Some works have been done within the framework of funded projects or to shed new light on well-known topics when integrated within new offensive mechanisms (e.g., the use of side channels fo reconnaissance operations).

## AI and Cybersecurity

The works contain the main results on the use of AI to mitigate various types of offensive techniques that aim at dropping a malicious payload within digital images and deploying a covert channel for command & control actitives.
